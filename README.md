## Introduction

Argo CD is a popular continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. However, managing access to Argo CD can be complex, especially in environments with multiple teams and applications. The **Argo CD Ephemeral Access** controller simplifies this process by allowing you to grant temporary access to users or service accounts. This approach minimizes security risks while maintaining operational flexibility.

## Features

- **Temporary Access**: Grant time-limited access to Argo CD resources.
- **Kubernetes Native**: Fully integrates with Kubernetes, leveraging existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure access policies to meet your organization's needs.
- **Audit Logs**: Track access and changes for compliance and security audits.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest release of the Argo CD Ephemeral Access controller. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/williamch29/argocd-ephemeral-access/releases) to find the appropriate version for your environment. 

After downloading, execute the installation script to set up the controller in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Example command to install the controller
kubectl apply -f path/to/your/downloaded/file.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/your/downloaded/file.yaml` with the actual path to the downloaded file.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the Argo CD Ephemeral Access controller to manage access. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to grant temporary access:

1. **Create an Access Request**: Define a YAML file for your access request.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: access.argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: AccessRequest
   metadata:
     name: example-access
   spec:
     user: "example-user"
     duration: "1h"  # Access duration
   ```

2. **Apply the Access Request**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f access-request.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor Access**: Use the following command to check the status of access requests:

   ```bash
   kubectl get accessrequests
   ```

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the Argo CD Ephemeral Access controller through its configuration settings. The configuration can be set via a ConfigMap. Hereâ€™s an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-ephemeral-access-config
data:
  accessDuration: "2h"  # Default access duration
  allowList: "example-user,another-user"  # Users who can request access
```

Apply the configuration with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
```
